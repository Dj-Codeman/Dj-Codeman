<H1> WELCOME </H1>

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dj-Codeman and I have absolutly no idea what I'm doing

We made sand do math and I want to learn the diffrent ways the sand works.

<H3> The reason my github exists is two fold.</H3>

  * Uno hand I take terrible backups and having something to acces my crappy code from anywhere is cool.

  * Two the goal is to learn a little bit of alot of languages and highlight my progects here, also suffring
    in public is a better way to get help then in silence. So if you see something stupid drop and issue or anything. 

<H2> No the entire page won't be considered an issue. </H2>

I'm currently working on / learning learning python3 and golang. there will be a golang progect soon but I'm out of ideas.

If for some terrible reason you need to reach me shoot me an email at dwhitfield@ramfield.net
